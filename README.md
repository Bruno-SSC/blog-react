## Briefing ğŸ“„

In order to improve my react i'm using codelÃ¢ndia challenge one. This time I'll be building this simple frontend using react. I did it last time whith pure html and css.

It does have "edit mode" and "add post" options but they aren't properly working because I did some mistakes while building how the "posts" would be storaged and all the code is messing up. I giving up on it lol, there is no reason to keep trying add more features since they are buging each other. Next project I'll be doing it right.
